## Programming Exercise 17 - Keeping a running journal
Allow a user to keep a running journal of field notes.  Each time the program starts, ask the user if they want to read the journal or add an entry.

If they want to read it, print the entire contents of the file to the screen.
If they want to add an entry, ask them to type a series of lines of text and terminate with the work "QUIT" on a single line.  

Ensure that the entire contents of the journal are preserved!
