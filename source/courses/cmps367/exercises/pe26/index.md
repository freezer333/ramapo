## Programming Exercise 26 - Plotting Rainfall

In [programming example 20](../pe20) and [21](../pe21) we created programs to read rainfall data from a text file and let the user search for data by year and month.

Extend your program to let the user request any of the following, by presenting a text-based menu:

- Plot of rainfall over a given year (x-axis is months, y-axis is rainfall)
- Plot of yearly rainfall totals (x axis is years, y-axis is rainfall total for that year)
- Plot of monthly averages, min, max (x-axis is months, y-axis is average/min/max as separate data points)
