## Programming Exercise 25 - Drawing some shapes

In Module 16 we saw a class hierchy developed with shapes, circles, and rectangles.

In this example we'll use the [ezgraphics](http://www.ezgraphics.org/) to actually draw some circles and rectangles.  

- Add a tuple property to the base shape class that represents an x,y position (center) of the shape
- Add a draw() method to the circle and rectangle class that uses the ezgraphics library to draw to the screen.  

*Note - you'll need to consult the documentation - found [here](http://www.ezgraphics.org/UserGuide/UserGuide).  Its fairly straightforward, and its a good exercise for you to get used to learning and integrating libraries into your programs.
