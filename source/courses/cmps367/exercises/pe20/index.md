## Programming Exercise 20 - Reporting Monthly Rainfall

Using the data found in [njrainfall.txt](../../data/njrainfall.txt), build a table (a list of lists) representing monthly rainfall.  

Each element in the list should be a tuple, each of which contains two elements:  the year, and a list of monthly rainfalls

Ask the user for a year and month and report the rainfall that month, along with the average rainfall for that month over the course of the entire year range of the data

You can get the actual data here from [Rutgers](http://climate.rutgers.edu/stateclim_v1/data/njhistprecip.html)
  
** This is the first *really* challenging programming example where you need to think about data organization.  Don't be discouraged and if you get stuck watch the solution video! **
