## Programming Exercise 5 - Finding the largest odd number again
Ask the user to enter a series of positive integers.  When they enter a -1, you can stop.

Print out the largest odd number they entered.  If they didn't enter any odd numbers then just simply say so.

* This is similar to Programming Excercise #1, but the user can enter any number of numbers.  Fortunately, using a while loop, this actually is a bit easier than you might think! *
