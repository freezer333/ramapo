## Course Summary
This course covers common computational approaches to solving scientific problems using the Python programming language.  The first half of the course is dedicated to mastery of the Python language within the context of fundamental computer science topics, such object orientation, algorithmic complexity, recursion, and debugging/testing.  The second half of the course focuses on practical scientific applications of Python in data analysis and experimentation.  Student will develop programs using stochastic models, experimental probability and statistics, Monte Carlo simulation, regression analysis, and dynamic programming.  PyLab, a graphing library similar to MatLab, will be utilized such that students can develop programs to report results using scatter plots, bar graphs, histograms, etc.  

This course is specifically designed for students **who already have experience programming**, be it in C++, Java, C#, Python, or other languages.  It is not intended to be taken as a first programming course, however you do not need to be a Computer Science major to take it (the course is also geared towards Bioinformatics students, Data Analytics students, and other students with technical backgrounds).

<h2 style="clear:both">Hybrid Course Delivery</h2>

**This course is primarily online, and asynchronous - meaning you can access course material at any time.**  While all modules/assignments are accessible from this site, we will use [moodle](http://moodle.ramapo.edu/) to submit all programming assignments electronically.  Since you will be required to come to class to take the exams, the college requires that this course be listed as "Hybrid".

**Please review the college's guide to online courses and moodle [here](http://www.ramapo.edu/summer/online/)**.

## About taking an online course
If you have never taken an online course, you may be surprised how easy it is to fall behind.  Below I have explained the way the course is organized, and if anything is unclear please email me ASAP.  The number one thing to remember is that you need to keep pace with the content on moodle, making sure that you master each week’s modules on a consistent basis.  **Computer science, perhaps more than any other subject, builds from lesson to lesson**.  There is no lesson/module that can be safely “skipped” - they will all come back to haunt you if you don’t understand them (or don’t try to learn them!).  **So please - keep up with the work**!.

### How to get help:
I will respond to emails very quickly, so whenever you are struggling with a concept, program, or anything else - please get in touch.  It is best to send me your code as an attachment with any email, so I can see precisely what you are doing.  Please also attend office hours whenever you need help.

# Course Objectives
This course prepares a student to utilize computer programming in scientific and experimental applications and analysis.  Students will gain (1) an understanding of the Python programming language, including concepts such as conditional branching, loops, functions, object orientation, and recursion; (2) a broad understanding of numerical methods, algorithmic complexity, and scientific programming concepts such as stochastic programs, probability, Monte Carlo simulation, and dynamic programming.

1. Students will be able to write and execute Python programs using all of the following programming concepts: conditional execution, looping, and iteration, collection data types, functions, recursion, function objects, and object orientation
2. Students will be able to apply Python programming skills to scientific and computational problems such as: presentation of statistical data in graphical form, stochastic models, Monte Carlo simulation
3. Students will be able to effectively integrate their knowledge such that they can contribute to open-source, professional-level Python-based applications.

The course will follow the textbook quite closely, it is a required resource.

Note the version of the textbook.  The modules follow this version, not the most current version.  

For all of the material and exercises in this course students may use any operating system Python runs on (which include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and all distributions of Linux).

Students will need a source code editor - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are recommended - but any editor will be fine.  Students must have Administrator access to the machines they work on in order to [install Python (version 3)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it is not already installed.

<h1 style="clear:both">Modules</h1>
The course has been organized into a series of modules, each of which covers an individual topic of the course.  Each module will include at least one slide deck, along with a video recording of the lecture corresponding to the slides.  Many modules will have a series of lectures associated with them.  

Most modules also have programming exercises associated with them which you should complete (on your own).  Solutions and video recordings of the solution being developed are also posted - however I strongly recommend you try each exercise on your own before watching me solve it!  And of course - the way I solve it may not be the only correct way to do so!

I **strongly** recommend you work through each module in order - programming is not the type of thing that you can skip around with...

## Homework
There are 5 assigned homework problems, with due dates listed on the schedule below, and on moodle.  Homework programs will likely require 3-6 hours of your time, and will be more involved and complex than the non-graded programming exercises.  I will provide feedback on homework, and partial credit will be given.  **No late homework will be accepted.**

|Link to Homework Assignment| Due Date
|--|----
| [Homework 1](../hw/hw1/) | 10/3
| [Homework 2](../hw/hw2/) | 10/31
| [Homework 3](../hw/hw3/) | 11/14
| [Homework 4](../hw/hw4/) | 11/28  **Requires C++ Programming**
| [Homework 5](../hw/hw5/) | 12/12

## Schedule & Recommended Pace
The semester is organized around 5 homework assignments, 2 exams, and the final.  While I have provided recommended Modules for each week below, your only responsibility is that you are complete the assignments by their due dates and that you are prepared to take each exam - which cover all modules noted.  Other than that, you may work at your own pace.

## Exams + Final
Exams, as noted on the schedule **must be taken with the class, in ASB 426**.  You are responsible for ensuring that you know, ahead of time, how to use the Windows machines in this lab for Python 3x development.

Each exam will contain significant amounts of live programming, of similar complexity to programming practice problems presented in each module, and the homework assignments.  Be prepared to spend most of the 3 hour period programming.

Each exam will be open book, notes, internet - however the machines will be monitored.  Absolutely no communication with anyone - through social media, email, text, etc.  No electronic devices (aside from the lab machine) are permitted to be used during exams.

## Policy on Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

**Please consult my explanation of academic integrity regarding computer science [HERE](/~sfrees/integrity.html)**.

For homework programming assignments, you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.   If sharing of source code is suspected, intentional or otherwise, both parties will immediately be referred to the Office of the Provost.

# Students with Disabilities:
If you need course adaptation or accommodations because of a disability that has been documented with the Office of Specialized Services, please make an appointment during my office hours.
