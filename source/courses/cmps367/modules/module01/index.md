## Module 01 - Introduction to Computation
[back to outline](../../outline.html)
### Summary
This module will show you how to set up your machine so you can write and run Python code.  You'll learn about the very basic parts of a Python program, and a bit about the various versions of the language.  

You should write and run your first program in conjunction with this module before continuing to the rest.

**Important Note**:  The textbook makes use of IDLE, which is an integrated development environment.  I will not be using this - instead I will write my programs in a popular multi-language code editor - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).  The program is free to try (although the author asks that you purchase a license if you use it for a prolonged period of time).  Purchase is **not** required for this course.

You are not required to use Sublime Text - any code editor will be sufficient.  In addition, if you prefer to use IDLE, you may do so.

Most of my lectures will be done on Linux or Mac OSX.  You may use Microsoft Windows as well.  Python code runs on all platforms - however the command line in Windows is slightly different than Linux and Mac OS X.  Sublime Text is compatable with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
