[back to outline](../../outline.html)
### Summary
This module examines runtime and algorithm design specifically focused on searching lists.  We'll look at linear, and then binary search algorithms and write some code that measures their runtime.

We'll also look at two different implementations of testing programs for search, offering a look at how functions, classes, and function object can improve the readabilty and overal design of a program.
