## Course Description
A study of the design, use, and analysis of operating systems. The course will include a study of the supportive computer architecture, memory management, process management, information management, device control, operating systems structure, and evaluation.  

## Pre-Requisites
CMPS 231 Data Structures, CMPS 220 Assembly Language Programming, and MATH 237 Discrete Structures, CRWT 102 Crit. Reading & Writing 2

## Course Materials
**Textbook** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Modern Operating Systems (4th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-4th-Edition/dp/013359162X) by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Herbert Bos. *Note, the textbook is required for this course, and will be relavent to nearly each lecture.*

## Required Programming Environment
**Attention Microsoft Windows Users** - while we will touch upon the Win32 API, the vast majority of the programming you will do in this course will require you to write C++ code targeting the POSIX API, which is supported by Max OS X and Linux.  You will absolutely be required to program in the POSIX environment, so if you do not currently use OS X or Linux, you'll need to create an environment.  

If you are using Windows, you can install Linux alongside Windows without too much trouble.  You have a few options:

1. You could configure your computer to dual-boot into Windows or Linux.  This is an advanced option - please do so at your own risk!  I'd recommend using either Ubuntu or Linux Mint for easy installation.  I've provided some additional info on this [here](linux_install.html).
2. You could install Linux in a Virtual Machine, such as Virtual Box.  Again, you may choose any Linux distribution but I'd recommend Ubuntu or Mint if you are unfamiliar with Linux.
3.  The least *invasive* option is to simply install a small Linux environment accessible via the command line *while working in Windows*.  This is a great option if you've never used Linux before.  I've prepared detailed instructions, which can be found [here](vagrant.html).

## Course Objectives
* Understand and Program Processes & Threads
* Understand and Evaluate Scheduling / Synchronization / Deadlock algorithms
* Understand Memory Management and Paging Systems used in a typical OS
* Understand and Program with File Systems and understand their implementation
* Understand Security issues involved with an OS
* Understand and evaluate different problems associated with Distributed Systems and Networking
* Understand modern OS directions and trends

## Lecture Schedule
Below is a tentative schedule for the course.  All topics and due dates are subject to change, and if there is a difference between what is stated here and on Moodle, please always consider Moodle to be correct (and let me know so I can correct the mismatch!).

**You must keep up with the readings** associated with each lecture.

## Written Report (WI Component)
Writing will be integrated into the life of this course. You will receive comments, direction, and support as you work on strengthening your writing skills. Your writing will be evaluated and returned in a timely fashion, allowing you to incorporate my comments into your future work. For help outside the classroom, please see me during my office hours and/or work with a writing tutor in the Center for Reading and Writing (CRW), Room: L-211, x7557, crw@ramapo.edu.

You will write a written report on the history, evolution, and design of ONE of the following major operating systems in use today:

* Microsoft Windows
* Apple OS X
* Linux
* Google Android
* Apple iOS

The paper will technical aspects of the platforms, but largely focus on the its history and development.  While technical details are must (for example, what type of filesystem does the OS use?), your efforts on this report should be directed on clearly articulating where the operating system came from (did it evolve from something else?), how it became what it is today (were there any releases that were failures, spectacular successes?), and where it is headed (is it on its way out, or is it primed to take over the world?).

* A first draft is due on 3/30/2017.  This draft is expected to be a complete paper, and you will be graded on its quality.  I will offer advice for revisions.
* **Your final draft is due the last day of class (before finals)**.  Your grade is based on the quality of your writing, the depth in which you covered the subject, and how you responded to revision requests from your first draft.



## Late Policy
All assignments will be turned in electronically.  A late penalty of 5 points per day will be applied to all late assignments.  The required format/method of your electronic submissions will be outlined for each assignment.  Deviation from these requirements may result in a 5-point penalty.  

## Attendance Policy
Attendance will be recorded by the instructor and, along with class participation, will be a determining factor in making border-line final grade decisions

## Grading

## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SPECIFIC TO THIS COURSE  
For programming assignments (Homework Assignments), you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.  

IF SHARING OF SOURCE CODE IS SUSPECTED, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, BOTH PARTIES WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.

## Make-Up Exam Policy
Make-ups will not be given for the exams given during the semester.  Failure to attend class on those days will result in a zero.  Make-ups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances (college approved absence) such as a documented medical or religious absence.

# A Note on Sexual Misconduct 
Ramapo College is committed to fostering a safe, productive learning environment. Title IX and our college policy prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.  Sexual misconduct — including harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking are prohibited.  The College encourages anyone experiencing sexual misconduct to talk to someone about what happened, so they can get the support they need and our college can respond appropriately.
 
If you wish to speak confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, please contact the Counseling Center at 201-684-7522 or 201-684-6666 during nights and weekends. If you wish to report sexual misconduct or have questions about policies and procedures regarding sexualmisconduct, please contact Kat McGee, the College’s Director of Title IX at 201-684-7220.
 
The College is legally obligated to investigate reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the confidentiality of a report, but it will consider a request for confidentiality and respect it to the extent possible.  
 
As a faculty member, I am also required by our College to report incidents of sexual misconduct and thus cannot guarantee confidentiality, but I will respect your privacy and only share the information with those who have a duty to respond. Should I become aware of an incident involving sexualmisconduct, I must provide our Title IX Coordinator with relevant details such as the names of those involved in the incident.
