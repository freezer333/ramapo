# Structured Programs and Data
These next two weeks really are *Python bootcamp*.  If you have never seen Python before, there is quite a bit of material to cover.  **Please ask for help**.

## Python Videos
The following videos are part of my CMPS 130 course material.  For those of you who are very new to programming or Python, these may be helpful for you.  Note, they are geared towards entry level undergraduates - feel free to skim/fast-forward, or skip - these are simply provided as an additional resource to you.

There is a lot of material here - however understanding functions, tuples, lists, dictionaries is **incredibly** important - please make sure you are up to speed on these concepts!

- [Recursion](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module06)
- [Global Variables](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module07)

- [Reading and Writing Files](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module09)
- [Tuples](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module10)
- [Lists](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module11)
- [Dictionaries](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module12)

- [Exceptions and Assertions](https://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/cmps130/modules/module14)

## Reading (Python)
- **Guttag**:  Chapters 4-7
- **McKinney**:  Chapter 2-3
  - Note, the McKinney book is *optional* for Python beginners.  Chapter 2 begins to describe Jupyter notebooks, and we won't use them for a few more weeks.  Chapter 3 is really covering the same material  as Chapters 4-7 in Guttag.  
  - **If you already know Python**, use McKinney as a review, rather than the Guttag text.  If you don't already know Python, stick to Guttag and skip McKinney for this week.

## CSV and JSON Files
For the weekly project, you will be starting to work with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.  Python supports reading and writing CSV files right out of the box.  [See the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

CSV files are extremely popular in Data Science.  They are very compact, easily readable by programs, and can be viewed easily in Microsoft Excel.  CSV can have variations as well - where characters other than commas are used as the seperating delimiter.

In the weekly project you are also asked to produce a JSON file.  JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is an extremely common way data is stored in most software development fields, especially in web development.  JSON is not quite as common in Data Science, largely because it struggles with large data sets (it is not compact).  

Python can produce JSON using it's `json` module. [See the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)

## Weekly Project
This week we have a larger data analysis project that will give you a chance to make use of many of the concepts we've been learning - including functions, lists, and dictionaries

## In-class Agenda
This week's in-class meeting will largely be dedicated to functions, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.  Please make sure you are ready to ask questions!
