For digits:

This is a way to introduce students to how machine learning works.  Have them create the plot (give them the code for matplotlib).
Then ask them to plot a sample image on the plot - and explain what it tells them.
Then, explain that this is an example of ML - plot on a map, which category is it?
Explain high dimensionality of data.
Need to provide significant help with the PCA process...
