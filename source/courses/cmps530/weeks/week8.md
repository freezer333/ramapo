# Data Analysis with `pandas`
This week we will be continuing to learn and use `pandas`, with more emphasis on the split, apply, combine paradigm.

## Reading (Python)
- **McKinney**:  Chapter 7-8, 10

*Chapter 10 in McKinney will introduce you to the `apply` and `groupby` methods, which are critical for this week's project.*

## Weekly Project
In Weekly Project 6, we revisit the Movies data set we worked on a few weeks ago.  Once again, we will re-do the very same analysis, but this time leveraging `pandas` - highlighting just how powerful the library is, and how much effort is saved by using it!

## In-class Agenda
This week we will continue our focus on `pandas` and data aggregation.  We will go over solutions to the previous week's project as well.
