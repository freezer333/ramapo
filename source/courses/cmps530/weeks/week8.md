# Data Analysis with `pandas`

Transforming Data

## Python Videos
- Find some good `pandas` tutorial videos
- Data Joining, transformations
- Lecture video (or live) on `groupby` and `apply`

## Reading (Python)
- **McKinney**:  Chapter 7-8, 10

*Chapter 10 in McKinney will introduce you to the `apply` and `groupby` methods, which are critical for this week's project.*

## Weekly Project
In Weekly Project 6, we revisit the Movies data set we worked on a few weeks ago.  Once again, we will re-do the very same analysis, but this time leveraging `pandas` - highlighting just how powerful the library is, and how much effort is saved by using it!
