# Data Analysis with `pandas`

TBD

## Python Videos
TBD
<!--
- Find some good `pandas` tutorial videos
- Create a lecture video for file formats
    - CSV vs Excel
    - Compact binary formats (pickle, hdf)
    - Data compression formats
- Lecture video (or live) on `groupby` and `apply`
-->
## Reading (Python)
- **McKinney**:  Chapter 5-6, 10

*Chapter 10 in McKinney will introduce you to the `groupby` methods, which you will find useful in this week's project.  Next week's project will utilize aggregation even more.*

## Weekly Project
In Weekly Project 5, you'll use `pandas` on a data set of game data from Major League Baseball from 1871 to present(ish).  Unlike previous projects, you are left to design your program any way you see fit - and to utilize `pandas` any way you wish - so get started on this early, and expect to spend more time thinking about *how* to solve the problems - not just thinking about python itself.

## In-class Agenda
This week we will focus on some very core concepts of `pandas`, like aggregation and data transformations.  We'll also explore and compare some key data formats, like CSV, Excel, pickle, hdf, and data compression.
