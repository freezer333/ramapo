# Simulation and Modelling, Working with Experimental and Statistical Data
Over the next two weeks we'll be applying what we've learned about Python to start modeling real world systems and making predictions and observations.  Developing models for real-world systems is a big part of Data Science!

There is a lot of reading over the next two weeks - much of which is focused on statistics.  Don't worry - this won't turn into a statistics class (you are taking a statistics course anyway!).  **Focus on how models are developed computationally**.


## Videos
- TBD


## Reading (Python)
- **Guttag**:  Chapters 12-21

## Weekly Project
In Weekly Project 9, we will use Python to explore winning streaks found in the past 50 or so years of Major League Baseball.  We'll develop a model for predicting how many lengthy win streaks we'd expect to see, and compare that with our observed data set.
