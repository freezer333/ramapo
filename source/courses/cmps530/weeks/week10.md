# Accessing SQL Databases
So far most of the data we've used in class was contained within csv files - essentially text files.  While this is simple and effective, there are far more efficient ways to store data.  

While there are many types of databases, this week we will take a look at the broadest segment - **relational databases**, and the associated programming language used to access them - SQL.

- [SQL Tutorial](https://www.sqltutorial.org/) - comprehensive guide to the SQL language
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - an embedded SQL database.  You won't need to install this yourself, we'll use python's built-in functionality.
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) - good for debugging, looking directly at your data set.
    
## Reading (Python)
- **Guttag**:  Chapters 11
- **McKinney**:  Chapter 9

## Weekly Project
In Weekly Project 8, we will use SQLite to analyze a financial data set consisting of about 2 million loans.  We'll also see how `matplotlib` can integrate into an SQL based project, and compare how the SQL technique compares to a purely `pandas` based analysis.

## In-class Agenda
Our focus in our live session this week will be SQL.  SQL is a core Data Science skill - and while databases evolve fast, SQL is a mainstay!
