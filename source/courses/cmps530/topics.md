# Semester Topics
Each week will you will be responsible for reading materials for one or both of our textbooks, along with assigned online material which may be in the form of tutorials, articles, documentation, and videos.  You are expected to work through this material each week **before** our in-person meeting time that week.  This is the asynchronous/hybrid aspect of our class.

We will meet together each week on Thursday nights for approximately 1 hour.  Most weeks, I will use this time to lecture on particular topics that need further discussion, as well as to help you understand the content in more depth.
