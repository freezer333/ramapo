## Course Description
This course introduces students to the fundamental programming concepts and skills utilized by Data Scientists - in particular parallel computing, input/output, and visualization - all through the Python programming language and associated libraries (i.e. numpy, pandas, etc.).  The course is suitable for students with a basic knowledge of programming, and prepares students to take more advanced computing courses in databases, big data analytics, machine learning, and other DATA and CMPS electives.

## Course Goals
This course serves as the gateway into graduate level coursework in Data Science and Computer Science.  Students with basic knowledge of programming are introduced to the Python programming language, including advanced topics such as parallel computing and algorithmic complexity.  Students will spend significant time learning core Data Science Python modules, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit.  Students will be prepared for more advanced coursework in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Databases.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Demonstrate advanced skills in data acquisition and management
2. Demonstrate the ability to process and synthesize data through modelling
3. Demonstrate advanced skills in data presentation and visualization

## Required Texts, Readings, Materials
- Guttag, J.V (2016). Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data (2nd Edition). The MIT Press.  ISBN 978-0262529624.
- McKinney, W (2017).  Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython (2nd Edition). O'Reilly Media. ISBN 978-1491957660.

## Course Requirements
- **Classroom Participation** – Class participation, while not directly graded, is expected and encouraged throughout the semester. Attendance is mandatory, and 5% of your final grade is based on the percentage of classes you have attended.
- **Projects** – You will be assigned two long-term projects which require data analysis with Python.  You can expect these projects to take roughly 20 hours to complete.  You will be given a full description of the project 3 weeks in advance of it’s due date.  All source code for programming projects will be submitted using Moodle, and you will have a separately scheduled 15 minute meeting with the instructor to review your work.
- **Examinations** – There will be two programming exams, in addition to a final exam (mixture of short answer and programming). These exams will encompass multiple chapters in the text, and their content will be explained during the lecture immediately preceding them.  Portions of the exams may be assigned to be completed prior to our meeting time on your own.

## Course Topics and Schedule
Each week will you will be responsible for reading materials for one or both of our textbooks, along with assigned online material which may be in the form of tutorials, articles, documentation, and videos.  You are expected to work through this material each week **before** our in-person meeting time that week.  This is the asynchronous/hybrid aspect of our class.

We will meet together each week on Thursday nights for approximately 1 hour.  Most weeks, I will use this time to lecture on particular topics that need further discussion, as well as to help you understand the content in more depth.

[The course's schedule and content can be accessed here](topics.html).

Assignments and portions of some exams will be managed in [Canvas](https://ramapo.instructure.com).  **Access keys** for working with our data sets are also found within Canvas.

**Note:** There are no D+ or D grades for graduate-level courses.  

## Late Policy
Projects must be completed on time, and will not be accepted past the due date.  Make up exams will not be granted unless written documentation of a medical or other serious emergency is provided.

## Attendance Policy
I expect you to attend all classes. If you are absent, then you are still responsible for all materials, assignments and exam announcements. You may want to get the contact information from at least two of your classmates to get this information. All graded events are scheduled on Canvas with due dates. 

A student who plans to miss one or more class sessions for religious observance, whether the religious holiday is recognized by the State of New Jersey or not, must notify the course instructor as soon as possible but no later than prior to the date of the religious holiday or the 50% refund date of the term in which the student is enrolled in the course (whichever comes first). The course instructor will not penalize the student for the absence and will allow the student to make up any work missed while absent for religious observance. Ultimately, it is the student’s responsibility to complete the work by the date agreed upon by the instructor and the student.
