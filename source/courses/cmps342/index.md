## Course Description
An introduction to computer graphics.  The course will include relevant coordinate geometry, graphic devices, primitive graphics operations, polygons, transformations, windows, clipping, and three-dimensional graphics.  The course teaches the fundamental techniques and skills of Computer Graphics utilizing WebGL - which is a modern graphics library built on OpenGL ES 2.0 and supported on nearly all modern computing devices, including mobile devices.  In addition to pure 3D computer graphics, students will also learn how to utilize the web - using HTML and JavaScript to deliver their 3D visualizations

## Pre-Requisites

*Note, the textbook is required for this course, and will be relavent to nearly each lecture.*

## Programming Environment
This course focuses on Computer Graphics, taught using WebGL - which is supported by most modern web browsers.  Throughout the course, you will required to program in JavaScript and utilize WebGL for high performance graphics.  To do so, you will need a source code editor.  I recommend the use of [Github's Atom editor](https://atom.io/) (which is installed in ASB computing labs).  Atom is freely available and runs on all operating systems.  Since we will also use GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), I recommend that you install the [language-glsl](https://atom.io/packages/language-glsl) plugin for Atom for proper syntax highlighting.

In order to develop with WebGL, you computer must support OpenGL ES Version 2.0.  Computers with reasonably new graphics processors generally support this, however you may need to install the latest available drivers from your device's manufacturer.

To test whether your browser and hardware support WebGL, please visit this [demo](http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/) site.  If you see a really nice demonstration of a ball in water... you are all set.  [Here's a Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0O_9bp3EKQ) of what you are supposed to see.  If you don't, you'll need to either update drivers, or use the ASB lab machines (I've verified that they do support WebGL).

## Course Objectives
* Basics of Computer Graphics, were it is used, how it has evolved.
* Graphics Elements (Points, Poly-lines, Polygons, Raster graphics)
* 2D/3D transformations
* Vector Arithmetic and its relationship to Computer Graphics
* 2D/3D Object transformations and camera positioning
* Parallel and Perspective 3D Viewing
* Shading and Texturing Techniques
* Raster Graphics Processing, Anti-Aliasing

## Lecture Schedule
Below is a tentative schedule for the course.  All topics and due dates are subject to change, and if there is a difference between what is stated here and on Moodle, please always consider Moodle to be correct (and let me know so I can correct the mismatch!).

**You must keep up with the readings** associated with each lecture.

## Resources
In addition to the textbook, there are many tutorials online that cover WebGL.  While the textbook (and much of my lecture material) is aimed at the fundamentals of computer graphics, these online resources will have more details specific to WebGL.

* [Learning WebGL](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217)
* [WebGL Fundamentals](http://webglfundamentals.org/)
* [THREE.js - JavaScript Scene Graph build with WebGL](http://threejs.org/)

Labs and Homeworks are worth the same amount of points.  The difference is that we will start labs in class, and you'll be able to work in pairs.  Labs turned in during the class time are able to earn 100%, labs turned in by the beginning of the next lecture are only eligible for a 90%.  Due dates listed above are subject to change, and indicate the date of the *following* lecture.

## Late Policy
All assignments will be turned in electronically.  A late penalty of 5 points per day will be applied to all late assignments.  The required format/method of your electronic submissions will be outlined for each assignment.  Deviation from these requirements may result in a 5-point penalty.  

## Attendance Policy
Attendance will be recorded by the instructor and, along with class participation, will be a determining factor in making border-line final grade decisions.  **More than 5 documented absences (more than 5 minutes late) will result in a deduction of 1 full letter grade.  I will begin this policy starting Monday, 1/28**.

## Grading

| % | Activity | Frequency/Description
|------------------:|:---------------|-------
|25%|Labs and Homework | Each lab/homework will be weighted equally
|40%|Exams | 2 exams during the semester
|35%|Final Exam | Comprehensive

## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SPECIFIC TO THIS COURSE  
For programming assignments (Homework Assignments), you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.  

IF SHARING OF SOURCE CODE IS SUSPECTED, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, BOTH PARTIES WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.

## Make-Up Exam Policy
Make-ups will not be given for the exams given during the semester.  Failure to attend class on those days will result in a zero.  Make-ups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances (college approved absence) such as a documented medical or religious absence.

# Students with Disabilities:
Ramapo College is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all students and to offer optional academic support for those with documented physical, sensory, learning, or psychological disabilities. Students can request academic accommodations by registering with the Office of Specialized Services (OSS). Information and documentation provided to OSS are held in confidence as educational records. Students can utilize these services at any time after registering with OSS. Students who need course adaptation or accommodations due to disability reasons should make an appointment to see an OSS representative during the first week of the semester. Please note: Students must be registered with OSS to receive accommodations. For additional information, The Office of Specialized Services (OSS) is located in the C Wing in room C205. The OSS phone number is 201-684-7514 (x7514) or you can email them at oss@ramapo.edu. 

# A Note on Sexual Misconduct 
Ramapo College is committed to fostering a safe, productive learning environment. Title IX and our college policy prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.  Sexual misconduct — including harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking are prohibited.  The College encourages anyone experiencing sexual misconduct to talk to someone about what happened, so they can get the support they need and our college can respond appropriately.
 
If you wish to speak confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, please contact the Counseling Center at 201-684-7522 or 201-684-6666 during nights and weekends. If you wish to report sexual misconduct or have questions about policies and procedures regarding sexual misconduct, please contact Kat McGee, the College’s Director of Title IX at 201-684-7220.
 
The College is legally obligated to investigate reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the confidentiality of a report, but it will consider a request for confidentiality and respect it to the extent possible.  
 
As a faculty member, I am also required by our College to report incidents of sexual misconduct and thus cannot guarantee confidentiality, but I will respect your privacy and only share the information with those who have a duty to respond. Should I become aware of an incident involving sexualmisconduct, I must provide our Title IX Coordinator with relevant details such as the names of those involved in the incident.
