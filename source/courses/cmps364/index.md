## Course Description
This course provides in-depth treatment of relational database design, the Structured Query Language (SQL), along with non-traditional databases such as key and document stores.
The first portion of the semester is dedicated to relational schema design, emphasizing normalization, ER and UML modeling, and aspects of the SQL DDL for creating constraints and relationships between data models.

The second segment of the semester is focused on SQL and query design. We will use the SQLite database through the Python programming language.

The third portion of the class is dedicated to a variety of different technologies related to data representation, storage, and retrieval. This includes JSON and MongoDB, and the Redis key-store database.

While the course will include discussions on database security, data protection, and administration, the primary focus of the course is software development using databases.

## Pre-Requisites
CMPS 231 Data Structures

## Course Materials
**Textbook** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Database Systems - The Complete Book - 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Database-Systems-Complete-Book-Edition/dp/0131873253) by Garcia-Molina, Ullman, Widom

*Note, the textbook is required for this course, and will be relevant to nearly each lecture.*

## Programming Environment
This course will require you to write SQL and Python code. You will need to install Python3 on your machine to do the programming work, however this will be explained in detail during class.  A simple text editor is all that is necessary for your programming, however installing a good programming editor is highly recommended. In addition, you will also need to install SQLite. SQLite is a relational database compatable with all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux).  It is highly recommended that you have access to your own computer to do your development on.

### SQLite
You can download SQLite (for Windows, Mac, or Linux) [here](https://sqlite.org/).  SQLite comes with a command line interface (CLI) which is described in much detail [here](https://sqlite.org/cli.html).  You may use the CLI if you wish, but you might also find a graphical front-end a bit easier to work with.  I recommend installing [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) for this purpose.  You may download the **portable** version (Windows) for use on campus lab machines.  

## Course Objectives
* Theoretical basis for relational database design
* Entity Relationship Diagrams
* UML Diagrams
* Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Advanced RDBMS topics such as
* Constraints and Triggers
* Views
* Index implementation
* Programming against Databases using Python
* Use of Document-store database (MongoDB)

## Lecture Schedule
Below is a tentative schedule for the course.  All topics and due dates are subject to change, and if there is a difference between what is stated here and on [Canvas](https://ramapo.instructure.com/), please always consider Canvas to be correct (and let me know so I can correct the mismatch!).

**You must keep up with the readings** associated with each lecture.

## Late Policy
All assignments will be turned in electronically.  A late penalty of 5 points per day will be applied to all late assignments.  The required format/method of your electronic submissions will be outlined for each assignment.  Deviation from these requirements may result in a 5-point penalty.  

## Attendance Policy
Attendance is not directly recorded.  I expect you to attend all lectures, and failure to do so will result in you missing critical course material and information.  In-class labs may not be made up, you must attend class to complete them.

## Grading

| % | Activity | Frequency/Description
|------------------:|:---------------|-------
|15%|In-class Labs | about 7 assignments
| 5%|Homework | 2 assignments
|15%|Programming Projects | 2 assignments
|35%|Exams | 2 exams during the semester
|30%|Final Exam | Comprehensive

## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SPECIFIC TO THIS COURSE  
For programming assignments (Homework Assignments), you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.  

IF SHARING OF SOURCE CODE IS SUSPECTED, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, BOTH PARTIES WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.

## Make-Up Exam Policy
Make-ups will not be given for the exams given during the semester.  Failure to attend class on those days will result in a zero.  Make-ups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances (college approved absence) such as a documented medical or religious absence.

## College-Wide Policies
Please see the College’s web page on policies that apply to all RCNJ courses, including this one.
