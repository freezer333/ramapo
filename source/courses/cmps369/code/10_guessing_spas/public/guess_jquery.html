    <!-- Note, we are using jquery CDN to get the code - we could also download and serve it ourselves. -->
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Its important to include jquery before anything that will use it.-->
    <script src='guess_jquery.js'></script>



<!--

    What you should notice about this example, as compared to the pure javascript example, is the absense of many of the id's and
    the event handlers.  They've been tucked away in guess_jquery.js, which uses the selectors in jquery to do most of this.

    The only things we have left are the id's for the individual "pages".
