## Course Description
An introduction to programming methodology including:  basic concepts of computer systems, the programming languages C/C++, algorithm design, program development, implementation, and testing.

## Online access
While all modules/assignments are accessible from this site, we will use [Moodle](http://moodle.ramapo.edu/) to submit all programming assignments electronically.

## About the hybrid version of this course
Hybrid courses substitute portions of regularly scheduled class time with online lectures.  This means that although most courses at Ramapo are scheduled to meet for 200 minutes each week, **we do not**.  That also means you will need to be responsible and disciplined with keeping up with the video lectures I'll provide (below).  The video lectures in the class largely replace the in-class lectures (they are not **optional!**).  

<p class="highlight">While we only meet for 100 minutes each week, you will need to be spending *at least* 100 minutes each week reading, listening, and working through the online lecture material.</p>

If you have never taken an hybrid course, you may be surprised how easy it is to fall behind.  When we meet in class, I will assume you've already viewed the assigned lectures online.  Most in-class meetings will be spent doing hands-on programming, using the concepts from the assigned video lectures.  I will be there to assist you, but it is your responsibility to have already digested and absorbed the material.    

Below I have explained the way the course is organized, and if anything is unclear please email me ASAP.  The number one thing to remember is that you need to keep pace with the content, making sure that you master each week’s modules on a consistent basis.  Computer science, perhaps more than any other subject, builds from lesson to lesson.  There is no lesson/module that can be safely “skipped” - they will all come back to haunt you if you don’t understand them (or don’t try to learn them!).  **So please - keep up with the work**!.

### How to get help:
I will respond to emails very quickly, so whenever you are struggling with a concept, program, or anything else - please get in touch.  It is best to send me your code as an attachment with any email, so I can see precisely what you are doing.  I will also hold regular office hours (see top of this page).

## Co-Requisites

100 level General Education Math.

## Course Materials - Required Programs and Textbook
You must have access to the internet and a computer suitable for installing Microsoft Visual Studio (i.e. any computer running Microsoft Windows 7 or above).   Microsoft Visual Studio is freely available - please consult the directions/tutorial [located here](../vs/VisualStudioAtHome.html).

If you have a Mac, you will be able to install similar programs on these machines.  Instructions for using Xcode can be found [here](http://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/xcode/).  You may also use [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/cdt/).  

You are required to obtain a copy of the textbook for this course, which will be an extremely critical resource used throughout the semester.  The textbook can be purchased at the college bookstore, or easily online (click image link below):

# Course Structure

## Modules
The entire course has been broken into individual modules.  Each module is posted as a slide show, and as a recorded video lecture (around 30-60 minutes in length each).  Each module will list, on the first slide, where in the textbook the topics discussed will be found.  You should approach each module as a set of resources - composed of the book chapter sections, the slides, the video, and the associated programming examples.  The textbook should be considered a required resource.

The listing below contains links to each module.  

<p class="highlight">It is your responsibility to view the Modules (and complete the assigned reading) on your own.  The schedule below outlines by which in-class meeting you are required to have complete the module for.  Viewing and reading through each module is NOT optional - they ARE THE LECTURES!</p>

### Programming Examples
The majority of modules will include several programming examples.  The module’s video lecture will include a recording of the solution being developed.  Source code for solutions to the programming examples is also provided below.  I highly recommend that you practice these examples without looking at the lecture videos or source code solutions as a method of preparing for the course’s exams.

All programming example source code from the modules is found in [Programming Examples.zip](../ProgrammingExamples.zip)

## Labs (In-Class)
Most weeks we will have an in-class lab session where you will be given a lab assignment to complete.  These labs are described in the lecture slides, and it is acceptable for you to work ahead if you wish, however your attendance at the in-class lab sessions is *mandatory*.

Each lab is designed to require roughly 60 minutes of programming time, but it varies greatly for each person, and for each assignment.  Each in-class lab session will start with a summary of what we've learned in the video modules, a question/answer session, and then you will complete the labs.  You are permitted to leave class as soon as you've shown me (and uploaded) your working lab code.

<p class="highlight"><b>Please understand,</b> labs *must be completed by the end of class*.  When you show me your completed lab, I will grade it on the spot (unless we are right at the end of the session).  Incomplete labs will receive (generous) partial credit, however I expect you to be asking for help throughout the session if you are having trouble.  Failure to attend class will result in a 0 for the lab.</p>

*There are two exceptions to Labs being due at the end of class.  On week 2, we will work on both Lab 2 and Lab 3.  Lab 3 won't be due before class ends, rather it is due before the following class - so you may finish it on your own time.  Lab 12 is extra credit, and is due before the final exam - we will not start it in class.*

<p class="angry">If you don't come to class prepared, you won't be able to complete labs in the time allotted.</p>

Labs are meant to be an opportunity to ask questions, and for me to help you.  The goals is for you to complete them during the class session - utilizing as much help from me as you need - so please ask questions!

**No late labs will be accepted**.

Labs represent 30% of your semester grade, so each lab is actually only about 3% of your overall grade.  Labs will be graded generously, honest attempts at completing the problem will result in a 7 or 8 out of 10 points.  A working program will earn a 10/10.  The purpose of these labs is so I can review your progress each week and provide feedback to you.

# Meeting Calendar
The calendar below is subject to change - please make sure you read your emails!  Note that while each schedule lecture includes either a lab or an exam, on days where we are doing labs I will generally lecture for about 20 minutes at the beginning of the session.  This lecture is NOT a replacement for the videos - it's just a brief review to get us ready for the lab.

## Policy on Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

<p class="highlight">When completing lab programming exercises, you may review code with your fellow students; however, copying source code is strictly forbidden.  For quizzes and exams, you are not allowed to communicate with anyone, for any reason.  
</p>
