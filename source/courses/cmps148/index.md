## Course Description
An introduction to programming methodology including:  basic concepts of computer systems, the programming languages C/C++, algorithm design, program development, implementation, and testing.

## Online access
While all modules/assignments are accessible from this site, we will use [Moodle](http://moodle.ramapo.edu) to submit all programming assignments electronically.  If you have any difficulty - please ask me (email me) right away!

### How to get help:
I will respond to emails very quickly, so whenever you are struggling with a concept, program, or anything else - please get in touch.  It is best to send me your code as an attachment with any email, so I can see precisely what you are doing.  

## Pre-Requisites

CMPS 147, 100 level General Education Math.

## Course Materials
You must have access to the internet and a computer suitable for installing Microsoft Visual Studio (i.e. any computer running Microsoft Windows 7 or Windows 8).   Microsoft Visual Studio is freely available - please consult the directions/tutorial [located here](vs/VisualStudioAtHome.html).

If you have a Mac (or run Linux), you will be
able to install similar programs on these machines.  For a Mac, please see my notes [here](../xcode/).  If you are using another operating system, please contact me for help if needed.

You are required to obtain a copy of the textbook for this course, which will be an extremely critical resource
used throughout the semester.  The textbook can be purchased at the college bookstore, or easily online (click image link below):

## Lecture Schedule
Below is a tentative schedule for the course.  All topics and due dates are subject to change, and if there is a difference between what is stated here and on Moodle, please always consider Moodle to be correct (and let me know so I can correct the mismatch!).

**You must keep up with the readings** associated with each lecture.

## Programming Examples
The majority of lectures will include several programming examples.  Below are solutions that will be derived in class:

# Course Assignments
You learn to program best by… programming a lot!  In this course I will be expecting you to write 3-4 programs each week of varying length.  These will be in the form of Labs and Homework programs.  You must submit all programs on moodle through the appropriate assignment links at the top of the course page.  It is imperative that you only submit the .cpp (source code) files when turning in your assignments.  I will build your programs and run them, so always triple check that you are submitting source code, and not some other Visual Studio related file (there are many!).  Note, in the first Module’s video, I will provided details instructions on how to get this right.

## Labs
The last half of som lectures will be used as a lab period, where you will be given programming assignments to reinforce lecture topic.  The labs are designed to require about 45 minutes of your time.  Labs are to be completed in class.  **No late labs will be accepted**.  You are **not** allowed to leave class early without completing the lab - if you do so you will receive a 0 on the lab.

Labs represent 10% of your semester grade, so each lab is actually only slightly more than 1% of your overall grade.  Labs will be graded generously, and honest attempt at completing the problem will result in a 7 or 8 out of 10 points.  A working program will earn a 10/10.  The purpose of these labs is so I can review your progress each week and provide feedback to you.  Please make every attempt to complete each on by the assigned due date.


|Lab Assignment| Due Date
|--|----
| [Lab 1](Labs/lab1/) | 9/12/2016 @12:40pm
| [Lab 2](Labs/lab2/) | 9/15/2016 @12:40pm
| [Lab 3](Labs/lab3/) | 9/22/2016 @12:40pm
| [Lab 4](Labs/lab4/) | 10/10/2016 @12:40pm
| [Lab 5](Labs/lab5/) | 10/20/2016 @12:40pm
| [Lab 6](Labs/lab6/) | 11/7/2016 @12:40pm
| [Lab 7](Labs/lab7/) | 12/5/2016 @12:40pm


## Homework
Homework programs will likely require 3-6 hours of your time, and will be more involved and complex than your lab assignments.  I will provide more detailed feedback on homework, and grading will be more discerning.  Homework programs 10% of your semester grade, each being 2.5%.  Late homework will NOT be accepted.

| [Homework 4](HW/HW4.pdf) | 12/5/2016 (@11:59pm)


## Exams (4 quizzes and Final Exam)
All exams are open book, open notes, and open computer/internet - but you must use the machines in our labs.   The only thing you are not allowed to use is any social media/email/chat program that can allow you to communicate with others.  Exams will be a mix of actual coding, and some written questions.

## Policy on Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

<div class="highlight">Please read a detailed description of my policy on academic integrity [here](../../integrity.html)</div>

When completing lab programming exercises, you may review code with your fellow students; however, copying source code is strictly forbidden.  For homework programming assignments, you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.   If sharing of source code is suspected, intentional or otherwise, both parties will immediately be referred to the Office of the Provost.

## Make-Up Exam Policy
Make-ups will not be given for the exams given during the semester.  Failure to attend class on those days will result in a zero.  Make-ups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances (college approved absence) such as a documented medical or religious absence.


# Students with Disabilities:
If you need course adaptation or accommodations because of a disability that has been documented with the Office of Specialized Services, please make an appointment during my office hours.
