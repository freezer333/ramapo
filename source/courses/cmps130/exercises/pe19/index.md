## Programming Exercise 19 - Building a list with no duplicates
Create a function called `removeDuplicates` which accepts a list and *modifies* that list such that all duplicates are removes.  **Hint** the easiest way to do this is to actually create a second list within the function and incrementally build it out of the original elements, making sure not to add anything that is already there.  Before returning, simply remove all from the original list and re-populate it.  

Your removeDuplicates should not return anything, it only modifies the list passed in as a parameter.
