## Programming Exercise 2 - Calculating a letter grade
Write a program that asks the user for a numeric grade.  Use a series of branching statements to print out the letter grade - where A is between 90 and 100, B is between 80 and 89, C is between 70 and 79, D is between 60-69, and anything lower is an F.  If the user types in a negative number or a number greater than 100, exit the program (using the `exit()` command) immediately.
