## Programming Exercise 14 - Computing Fibonacci Numbers
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:[1][2]

```
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...
```

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Write a recursive function that accepts a parameter N, and returns the Nth Fibonacci number (assuming fib(0) is 1, and fib(1) is one - meaning the sequence starts at the 0th number)

So, `fib(5)` should return `8`, and `fib(8)` should return `34`.

**As a thinking excercise**, using recursive turns out to be a *horrible* technique, the program could be done faster iteratively (using a standard loop).  Why?
