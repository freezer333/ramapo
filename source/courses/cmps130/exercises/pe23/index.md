## Programming Exercise 23 - Refining Exercise 20 & 21 with Exceptions

In [programming example 20](../pe20) and [21](../pe21) we created programs to read rainfall data from a text file and let the user search for data by year and month.

We blissfully ignored some issues:
1. What if the user asks for a year we don't have data on?
2. What if a user asks for an invalid month?
3. What if the file didn't exist in the first place?

Modify the program to handle these problems more gracefully.  Also, let users type months as strings, in full form (i.e. September) - rather than always typing numbers for months!
