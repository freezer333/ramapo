## Programming Exercise 21 - Refining Exercise 20 with Dictionaries

In [programming example 20](../pe20) we created a sort of awkward "list of lists", where rainfall data was organized as a list.  Each element in the list was a tuple with two values.  The first value was the year the element represented, and the second element was a list of rainfall totals for each month in that year.

The structure was awkward, but with dictionaries we can make it easier to work with.

Modify pe20 so that rainfall is organized as a dictionary:

Keys should be years
Values are lists of monthly rainfall totals for the corresponding year.


** This is the first *really* challenging programming example where you need to think about data organization.  Don't be discouraged and if you get stuck watch the solution video! **
