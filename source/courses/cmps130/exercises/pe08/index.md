## Programming Exercise 8 - Printing with nested for loops
Ask the user for a positive integer N, between 2 and 20.  Print a
vertical half diamond, where the top half has N rows, and the bottom half has N-1 rows.

So, for N = 4

<pre style="font-size:14pt">
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*
</pre>

###Guidelines
- Do the top half first (increasing order)
- Do the second half as a completely separate loop
- Remember, you’ll print out “n” number of stars on a line the same way whether you are doing the top half or bottom half!
