## Module 13 - Testing and Debugging
[back to outline](../../outline.html)
### Summary
This module is somewhat unique in this course in that I have nothing to add to the reading.  Please read chapter 6 at least twice - it contains tips and strategies that if you apply to your programming will **absolutely** make you a better programmer.  

Please don't take the fact that I have not provided slides as an indication I don't think this is important.  I think this may be the *most important* part of the book.  The book is extremely comprehensive though - so I want you to just focus on the text!

Towards the end of the semester, there will be a few additional modules like this as well - it is **your responsibility** to ask questions if anything doesn't make sense to you!
