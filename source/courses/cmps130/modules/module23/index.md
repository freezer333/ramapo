## Module 22 - Statistics, Simulations, and Distributions
[back to outline](../../outline.html)
### Summary
The final module of this course covers chapter 12 in the textbook - however as you will see when you read this chapter, there is no additional Python syntax being introduced.  Rather, it is showing you how the skills you've learned can no be **applied** towards scientific and engineering applications.

An important aspect of computer simulation is random variables, and in this module I will breifly explain random numbers and how to generate them in python.

The programming example listed below offers yet another example of using Python, and statistics, to build important tools.
