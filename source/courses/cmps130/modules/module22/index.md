## Module 22 - Using PyLab
[back to outline](../../outline.html)
### Summary
This module augments chapter 11 in the textbook and will help you get started using plotting in Python3.  Please note, PyLab, in the form it was used in the texbook, no longer exists in Python3.  Instead, its been subsumed into matplotlib.  The lecture slides in this module are largely about showing you how to use PyLab in Python3 by installing the matplotlib package.

<div class="highlight">** Important -  ** my lecture slides only augment the textbook, you will need to read it thoroughly to learn about using PyLab.  For an additional example, take a look at programming excercise 26 below. There are also additional links to documentation and tutorials. 

Welcome to programming - you'll need to get really good at picking up new packages and learning to use them on your own!  The good news is you have all the programming skills necessary at this point!

### Programming Excercises
- [Programming Exercise #26](../../exercises/pe26) - Plotting rainfall 

### Additional Material
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - the main site for the plotting functionality library we are using.
- [Plotting documentation](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) - a fairly good overview of plotting options
- [Tutorials recommended by matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/resources/index.html) *carefull, some of these tutorials go far beyond the material covered in the textbook.  This is great, but don't get too bogged down - you are only responsible for what is in the textbook!
