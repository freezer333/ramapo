# HNRS 420 - Lecture 9 <br/><br/>How technology is (has) changing politics

Technology - specifically social media, the Internet, crowd sourcing, and on-line petition platforms are changing the way the political process works.  In this lecture/debate, we'll look at the types of changes that are occurring, and focus our discussion on whether these changes have been positive, negative, or both.

## Course Discussion / Outline
**Debate Topics** 
* Do tools like change.org empower the public?  Or are they just an outlet to "vent"?  Are they the future?
* The Internet presents us with so many filtered and unfiltered choices when finding information - is the public more informed on issues now?  Or do we now simply find sources which echo are pre-existing beliefs?  Has this caused an increase in polarization?  How does this compare to the days where there were few sources of information?
* Has political discourse been diminished by the 140 character message?  Or is the "unpolished" view we get of politicians a good thing?
* Does the "permanence" of online information, social media posts, etc. get us to a point of greater accountability from our politicians?
* Politicians can now direct fundraising campaigns using data mining to seek out people with means to give - is this a good thing?  Can this information ultimately be misused to shape policy around the views of "donors" rather than the general electorate?
* In 2012, only 60% of registered voters actually voted.  Is online voting the answer?
