## Course Description
The focus of this course is the exploration of how computers have, and continue to transform our society.  The course will begin with a historical, and hands-on study of how a computer and the software that drives it is created, including a topical treatment of programming to familiarize the student with computing.  The course will then focus on the major innovations that computing is enabling in our society, and how these impact economics, ethics, and law.  This will include topics such as hacking and identity/financial fraud, crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, data mining and privacy issues, and the effects of automation and computerization on economic and social imbalances.  This course does not assume any previous experience in computer programming.

**This version of the course is being offered as an independent study.**

## Pre-Requisites

College Honors Program Admission.<br/>
Permission of Instructor required.

## Course Materials
Most of the reading required in this course will be material freely available on the web.  For each week, a listing of several (shortish) articles will be posted (see the individual lecture pages, accessible from the links in the 'Course Topics' section).

There are two books the class is **required to read**, which will be discussed in detail throughout the semester.  The first, [The Innovators](http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Revolution/dp/147670869X/ref=br_lf_m_239332_1_4_ttl?ie=UTF8&s=books&pf_rd_p=1953735202&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_i=239332&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1GM630QHX1T0PM1CW3AB), will give you a glimpse into some of the most important people in the history of computing.  The second, [Who Owns the Future](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1451654960/simonsayscom), presents a fairly opinionated discussion/idea about where technology and specifically computers are taking society.  These books will provide some common ground for the class to draw upon during debates and presentations.

### Reading Schedule
I am not rigidly structuring your progress through the two text’s (“The Innovators” and “Who Owns the Future”) – you may read roughly at your own pace.  However - here are my guidelines:

| The Innovators   | Who Owns the Future?    |
|:------|:--------|
| Read Chapters 1-5 by 3/3|Read Parts 1-3 by 3/3 |
| Read Chapters 6-9 by 4/7|Read Parts 1-3 by 3/3 |
| Complete the book by 4/25|Complete book by 3/28 |

## Course Assignments
The independent study version of this course requires the writing of 4 essays, plus short write-ups about the topics ordinarily discussed in class.  

### Essays
You will be required to write four essays.  Your grade will be based on how compelling of a topic you choose and the level of research, accuracy, and logic applied to your discussion and conclusions.  

**Each essay is expected to be 5-7 pages, double spaced (1.25" margins, 12pt font)**.

#### Essay 1 - Security Disasters (2/22)
The first essay will be on a specific instance where security issues have had a significant effect on the public.   This can be related to identity/financial fraud, privacy infringement (by hackers, companies, or the government), and infrastructure (cyber-terrorism, bugs).  

#### Essay 2:  Seminal Events in Computing (due 3/10)
Select a particular event, or invention/software release that you feel has "changed the world".  Do a deep-dive into how that event came to pass - who were the major players, what were the enabling events?

#### Essay 3 - Emerging Technologies (4/21)
The third essay is focused on an emerging technology.  Here are the potential topics:

* Quantum Computing - what does this mean for computing power?
* Autonomous Vehicles - From drones to self-driving cars - what will we be using in 5 years?
* 3D Printing - where is this going?
* Machine learning - are we seeing the beginning of a AI revolution?

*You must get approval from me for your topic*

#### Essay 4:  Computing and your major (due 5/2)
You must select an industry tied to your major, and explore how technology has changed it, or is in the process of changing it.  How has it helped the specific industry (the product)?  How has it effected the workforce?  Has this been a net-positive for society?  

### Topic Write-ups
In the normal version of this course, each class is designed to foster a rigorous class discussion around debate topics associated with the corresponding topic.

While taking this course as an independent study, debates and class discussion are replaced with additional writing.

Each writeup need only be 1 page.  You are to directly address one of the debate topics listed on the topic page (**see below for topic pages**).  You should state your opinion, and explain your reasoning.  Each writeup is graded on a scale of 0-3.  3 is excellent, 2 is good, 1 is unsatisfactory, and of course 0 is if you didn't turn it in.  Due dates are listed below:

For a few of the topics, no write-ups are required (no debate questions) - however I urge you to review the slides and material.

#### Course Topics
| Due Date | Topic
|------------------:|:---------------
|No Writeup Due| [History of Computing](lect01.html)
|2/8| [Open Source](lect03.html)
|2/15| [Security and Responsibility](lect04.html)
|No Writeup Due| [Your digital identity](lect05.html)
|3/3| [Encryption, government spying, and your privacy](lect06.html)
|3/10| [Silicon Valley and Ageism](lect07.html)
|3/28| [Disrupting Education](lect08.html)
|4/21| [Automated Society - Will we work?](lect11.html)

### Learning to code
The focus of this course is not to make you an expert in program, by any stretch.  However, there is a lot to be learned by walking a mile in the shoes of a programmer.  A valuable component of this course will be the completion
of a beginners tutorial in Python programming.  Python is a very beginner-friendly language, but is used extensively in both small and huge programming projects alike.

By 4/18, You are required to complete all lessons in [Code Academy's Python Course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python).
