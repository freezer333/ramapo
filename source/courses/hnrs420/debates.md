# HNRS 420 Spring 2016
We have 9 debate sessions scheduled for the semester.  The dates of each debate are shown on the course schedule.  Each of the topics listed below have outlines of what sort of questions the debate should focus on.  

1. **Open Source**:  Should software always be free?  Should programmers work for free, and can corporations use this work?  Is this economically fair and sustainable?
2. **Security and Responsibility**:  How much responsibility do corporations have in protecting your data?  How much liability do they, and should they, assume?  How much convenience are we willing to give up for security?
3. **Government, Spying, Privacy**:  Should government agencies have backdoors into security standards and access to encrypted data stored by corporations?
4. **Ageism and the Tech Industry**:  Is their ageism in tech, is it OK?
5. **Disrupting Education**: Is our education model obsolete?  Are we moving towards an online system?
6. **Technology and Politics**:  Has technology given people more or less power in the political process?  Has technology and the media made the political process more or less transparent?
7. **Net Neutrality**:  Should internet service providers control be allowed to base charges and speed on the content being transmitted, or the parties involved?
8. **Automated Society - Will we work**?  Will the automated society come to fruition?  If so, will the majority of use have to work?   What implications does this have on the economy, government, and society?
9. **Automated Society - An IP Based Economy**?  Can an economy where the primary good/service that you can produce is your own intellectual property sustain itself?

Each of you will participate in three of them, as a member of one of 6 debate teams.  Two debate teams are assigned to each of the scheduled debates.

For each debate you are assigned, you will have one team meeting scheduled during class time.  During this meeting your team(s) will be expected to have your slides presentations prepared, along with talking points, questions for audience, and debate research completed.  I will work closely with the teams during this session.  The meeting days are listed on the course schedule.

During the 5 meeting days listed on the schedule, **if your debate team is not involved, you do not need to attend class**.
