# Learning to code
The focus of this course is not to make you an expert in program, by any stretch.  However, there is a lot to be learned by walking a mile in the shoes of a programmer.  A part of this course will be the completion
of a beginners tutorial in Python programming.  Python is a very beginner-friendly language, but is used extensively in both small and huge programming projects alike.

By 4/18, You are required to complete all lessons in [Code Academy's Python Course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python).
