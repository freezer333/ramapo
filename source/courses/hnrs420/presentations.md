# Presentation Team Assignments
You have been assigned to one of 4 presentation teams, each with three students within it.  Your team will make a presentation three times - please check the [schedule](index.html) for dates.

#### Presentation 1 - Security Disasters
The first presentation will be on a specific instance where security issues have had a significant effect on the public.   This can be related to identity/financial fraud, privacy infringement (by hackers, companies, or the government), and infrastructure (cyber-terrorism, bugs).  

#### Presentation 2 - Disruption
The second presentation will focus on how technology has drastically changed certain industries, almost to the extent that they no longer (or soon will not) exist.  Potential industries could include print media, commercial driving, medical, law, or just about any industry!  Students are especially encouraged to pick industries that may intersect with their majors.  

#### Presentation 3 - Emerging Technologies
The third presentation is focused on an emerging technology.  Here are the potential topics:

* Quantum Computing - what does this mean for computing power?
* Autonomous Vehicles - From drones to self-driving cars - what will we be using in 5 years?
* 3D Printing - where is this going?
* Machine learning - are we seeing the beginning of a AI revolution?

Please note, a big part of this course is learning to work with others.  You will be grade on how well your team can put together an integrated presentation.  Unless there is a serious problem within a team, teams will be assigned one uniform grade for each presentation.  **If you have significant problem with any team assignment due to previous issues with another student, you may request a change by 1/28**.
